Two scripts that parse csv's to analyze data

## PyBank
This script reads a csv file of financial records and parses the data to make it into useful data. It analyzes the total number of months, total amount of profit/losses over a period, the average change in profit/losses, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. It prints out the results to the console while also creating a text file to view.

## PyPoll
This script reads a csv file of poll data and parses it to find out the results of a poll. It finds the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate received, the total number of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. It prints out the results into the console while also creating a text file to view.
